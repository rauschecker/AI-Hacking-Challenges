## Changes

The chatbot-ui base project was modified to connect to our custom backend. Thus the testbackend folder was removed and a custom backend implemented in Python (backend/ folder). Minor textual changes were made in src/index.html (Title) and src/components/custom/chatinput.tsx as well as src/components/custom/overview.tsx
